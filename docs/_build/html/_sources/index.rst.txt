A Fair Candidate Screening System's documentation
============================================================

Introduction
------------
In this work, we propose a fairness-aware AI-based system for candidate screening,
grounded in the analysis of a real-world dataset provided by the Adecco Group.
The dataset consists of AI-generated candidate-job matches enriched with demographic
and educational information. Our approach aims to detect and mitigate structural
and cognitive biases that may arise during algorithmic matching processes.
We begin by analyzing the data distribution to identify patterns of disparity,
and subsequently evaluate the fairness of the existing recommendation mechanism using
established bias metrics. To promote more equitable outcomes, we explore preprocessing
strategies and fairness-aware ranking techniques.
