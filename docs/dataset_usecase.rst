Dataset and use-case context
============================

The dataset used in our study originates from the Adecco Group and reflects a snapshot
of one dayâ€™s operation of their candidate recommendation system.
This system automatically matches job openings with potential candidates by analyzing
resume data and job requirements.

Key characteristics of the dataset:

- For each job position, the system outputs the *top 10* most compatible candidates.
- Candidate-job matches are ranked by match score (descending), with secondary sorting by candidate ID (ascending).
- The dataset is anonymized and includes demographic and contextual variables such as: age, gender, domicile region, education, job sector, etc.

This data offers a unique opportunity to examine the internal behavior of an existing
AI hiring tool and assess its fairness characteristics at scale.
